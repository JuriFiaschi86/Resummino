First steps are:

1) Create a HEPForge account
2) Be added by Prof. Michael Klasen to the Resummino project as admin.

The (latest) repository associated to the project is "resummino3.0".
Once you have been added to the Resummino project, you should have automatically the rights to edit the repository.

The repository is managed through the version control system GitLab.
The repository is associated to the GitLab repository of the university of Munster, at the address:
https://zivgitlab.uni-muenster.de/ag-klasen/resummino.git

To modify the repository, one has to clone the current version, with the command:
git clone http://phab.hepforge.org/diffusion/496/resummino-3.1.1.git

A new directory will be created with the current Resummino version in the repository.
One can modify the files in this directory locally. Once done, one has to add the modifications with:
git add .
Then commit the changes adding a comment with:
git commit -m "comment"
Then push the changes with:
git push


To edit the webpage, one has to edit the content of the HEPForge folder, which is accessible after ssh to the HEPForge account at the address:
/hepforge/projects/resummino/

To access the HEPForge space, the command would be of the kind:
ssh juri.fiaschi@login.hepforge.org -p 222

To upload new files (for instance in the folder containing the .html webpage files), the command would be:
scp -P 222 -r ./resummino_webpage/public_html/*.* juri.fiaschi@login.hepforge.org:/hepforge/projects/resummino/public_html

Before uploading new files, make sure that they have the correct permissions for read/write, i.e.:
chmod -R g+w *
